This is a tool to automate classifying and blocking IP Addresses

Using the AbuseIPDB api, this program will look at the Abuse Confidence Score (ACS).
This number can range from 0-100. If this number has ACS of more than 30 the IP
will appended to a list to be emailed to the NOC to have them block the IP address
on our load balancers. If the score is less than 30, the IP address will be emailed
to the IT Security team to review. 

## Installation
this is built to be run along side a sumo logic script action. Put abuseipdb_ref.py
into a new folder and point the list_of_files variable from the get_latest_file
function to your alerts.

### Usage
Once installed, create a cron job to run the python3 script every time a new
scrip action alert comes in. This will allow an instant action to take place.
